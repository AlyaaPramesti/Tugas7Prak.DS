## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data("murders")
murders
```

```{r}
murders_tibble <- as_tibble(murders)
murders_tibble
```

```{r}
murders_tibble %>% group_by(region)
```

```{r}
exp(mean(log(murders$population)))
```
```{r}
murders %>%
  .$population%>%
  log %>%
  mean %>%
  exp
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
df <-1:100 %>% 
map_df(~ tibble(n =(.x), s_n=(.x )*(.x+1)/2, s_n_2=(((.x)*(.x+1)/2)*((.x )*(.x+1)/2))))
print(df[1:100,])
```
